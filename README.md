# AnalysisOfSpeechDeepfakes


This repository provides the two frameworks for generating spoofed speech and then detecting the same

The spoofed speech generation is available in english and hindi language and is obtained via the MahaTTS developed by [Dubverse.ai]

The spoofed speech detection is done via the audio anti-spoofing systems proposed in ['AASIST: Audio Anti-Spoofing using Integrated Spectro-Temporal Graph Attention Networks'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01200)



### Getting started

Docker need to be installed on your system for both the frameworks
